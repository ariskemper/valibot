# Issues

When validating unknown data against a schema, I collect information about each issue and at the end, if there is at least one issue, I return them in an array. Each issue provides detailed information for you or your users to fix the problem.

## Issue info

The issues are an array of objects. In the following I will explain you exactly what information an issue contains and how this information can help you.

```ts
type Issue = {
  // Required info
  reason: IssueReason;
  validation: string;
  origin: 'key' | 'value';
  message: string;
  input: any;

  // Optional info
  requirement?: unknown;
  path?: PathItem[];
  issues?: Issues;
  abortEarly?: boolean;
  abortPipeEarly?: boolean;
  skipPipe?: boolean;
};
```

### Required info

Each issue contains the following required information.

#### Reason

`reason` describes the reason of the problem. If an input does not match the data type, for example a number was passed instead of a string, `reason` has the value `'type'`. In all other cases the reason is not the datatype but the actual content of the data. For example, if a string is invalid because it does not match a regex, `reason` has the value `'string'`.

#### Validation

`validation` describes which function did the validation. If the schema function <Link href="/api/array/">`array`</Link> detects that the input is not an array, `validation` has the value `'array'`. If the <Link href="/api/minLength/">`minLength`</Link> validation function detects that an array is too short, `validation` has the value `'min_length'`.

#### Origin

`origin` describes the source of the issue and, except for an issue on a key of a map or record, always has the value `'value'`.

#### Message

`message` contains a human-understandable error message that can be fully customized as described <Link href="/guides/schemas/#error-messages">here</Link>.

#### Input

`input` contains the specific data where the issue was found. For complex data, for example objects, `input` contains the value of the respective key that does not match the schema.

### Optional info

Some issues contain further optional information.

#### Requirement

`requirement` can contain further validation information. For example, if the <Link href="/api/minLength/">`minLength`</Link> validation function detects that a string is too short, `requirement` contains the minimum length that the string should have.

#### Path

`path` is an array of objects that describes where an issue is located within complex data. Each path item contains the following information.

```ts
type PathItem = {
  schema: string;
  input: unknown;
  key: string | number | symbol;
  value: unknown;
};
```

For example, you can use the following code to create a dot path.

```ts
const dotPath = issue.path.map((item) => item.key).join('.');
```

#### Issues

`issues` currently only occur when using <Link href="/api/union/">`union`</Link> and contains all issues of the schemas of an union type.

#### Config

`abortEarly` and `abortPipeEarly` gives you an info that the validation was aborted prematurely. You can find more info about this in the <Link href="/guides/parse-data/#abort-early">parse data</Link> guide. `skipPipe` indicates that the pipeline validation was skipped. These are configurations that you can control yourself.

## Formatting

For common use cases like forms, I can help you with small functions to format issues. However, once you understand how they work, you can easily format them yourself and put them in the right form for your use case.

### Flatten errors

If you are only interested in the error messages of each issue to show them to your users, you can convert an array of issues or a <Link href="/api/ValiError/">`ValiError`</Link> to a flat object with <Link href="/api/flatten/">`flatten`</Link>. Below is an example.

```ts
import * as v from 'valibot';

const ObjectSchema = v.object({
  key: v.string('Value of "key" is missing.'),
  nested: v.object({
    key: v.string('Value of "nested.key" is missing.'),
  }),
});

try {
  v.parse(ObjectSchema, { nested: {} }); // Throws an error
} catch (error) {
  console.log(v.flatten<typeof ObjectSchema>(error));
}
```

The <Link href="/api/ValiError/">`ValiError`</Link> thrown in the code sample above this text contains the following issues.

```ts
[
  {
    reason: 'type',
    validation: 'string',
    origin: 'value',
    message: 'Value of "key" is missing.',
    input: undefined,
    path: [
      {
        schema: 'object',
        input: { nested: {} },
        key: 'key',
        value: undefined,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    reason: 'type',
    validation: 'string',
    origin: 'value',
    message: 'Value of "nested.key" is missing.',
    input: undefined,
    path: [
      {
        schema: 'object',
        input: { nested: {} },
        key: 'nested',
        value: {},
      },
      {
        schema: 'object',
        input: {},
        key: 'key',
        value: undefined,
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

However, with the help of <Link href="/api/flatten/">`flatten`</Link> the issues were converted to the following object.

```ts
{
  nested: {
    key: ['Value of "key" is missing.'],
    'nested.key': ['Value of "nested.key" is missing.']
  }
}
```
